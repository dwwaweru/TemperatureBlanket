# Temperature Blanket
Information used to generate a temperature blanket crochet pattern. The date range for this project is August 14, 2020 to August 14, 2024. For each day, the color used to crochet the given row is based on the recorded high temperature. Based on this range, the program will return the appropriate color of yarn to use, plot a graphic of the blanket colors, and the approximate project cost.

## Packages
csv, pandas, matplotlib

## Pattern
For each day, crochet the row as a moss stich with a size 4.5 mm hook. For the month break, crochet 2 rows of white half-double crochets with a size 5.5 mm hook.

## Future Improvements
Use a weather API to automatically grab the historic temperature data.
