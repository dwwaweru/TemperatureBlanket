# Temperature Blanket
This project was an exercise in combining my passion for the fiber arts with programming to generate a temperature blanket crochet pattern. A temperature blanket is a blanket where a new row is crocheted each day for one year. For each day, the color used to crochet the given row is based on the recorded high temperature. Based on this range, the program will return the appropriate color of yarn to use, plot a graphic of the blanket colors, and the approximate project cost. This blanket is for my first year living in Ann Arbor, MI from Aug 14, 2020 to Aug 14, 2021.

## Packages
csv, pandas, matplotlib

## Pattern
For each day, crochet the row as a moss stitch with a size 4.5 mm hook. For the month break, crochet 2 rows of white half-double crochets with a size 5.5 mm hook.

## Future Improvements
- Use a weather API to automatically grab the historic temperature data.
- Allow user to input data range
